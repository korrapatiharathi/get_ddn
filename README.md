# get_ddn
A script that collects diag output, log output from the DDN system and also prints the list of known DDN systems and their addresses
Sample execution: ./get_ddn iforge-14k
Ideally, ./get_ddn <IPaddress> should give ddn related information of that specific ip-address but for now it is only limited to iforge-14k, sdd90, sdd91, sdd30, sdd31, sdd32, sdd33, cc-s10k, cc-s12k hosts
